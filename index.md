### Version Control
The use of version control, revision control or source control is used in order to manage changes of documents, as well as make changes in different versions of a document. Version control can even do things like going back to a previous version of the documents to change a part of a file or fix a bug. Using version control can also enable you to collaborate with people on projects or documents as well and go back to previous versions of documents if you ever needed to.
CTRL-Z can even be considered a very simple form of version control. Some programs also have a form of version control as well, like Wikipedia for example. Wikipedia has an edit history of all the website articles on Wikipedia.
