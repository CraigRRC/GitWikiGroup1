# Git 

## Version Control
The use of version control, revision control or source control is used in order to manage changes of documents, as well as make changes in different versions of a document. Version control can even do things like going back to a previous version of the documents to change a part of a file or fix a bug. Using version control can also enable you to collaborate with people on projects or documents as well and go back to previous versions of documents if you ever needed to.
CTRL-Z can even be considered a very simple form of version control. Some programs also have a form of version control as well, like Wikipedia for example. Wikipedia has an edit history of all the website articles on Wikipedia.

## What is Git?
Git is a free, open source distributed version control system. Git can help us in the use of keeping track of any changes to anykind of documents or files for projects. But using Git with cloud version control websites like GitHub or GitLab, we can then use it to collaborate with others remotely without needing to be at one computer. 

With Git, you can then make "commits", or a save point to save your work on a project, as well as commit as often as you like. The more you commit to a rpoject, the less likely it is for you to lose any changes or things you may have added. But a dowside to having Git is it isn't very user friendly for non-developers or anyone that is not used to using anything like Git, so Git then has a very steep learning curve. Using Git also means that there is no built-in support for large repositories. But Git LFS add-on exists for larger file storage. Also Git has no built-in support for locking binary assets. but with Git LFS it can be enabled to be able to if you wanted to.
